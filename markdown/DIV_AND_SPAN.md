## Div and Span

`<div>` and `<span>` are container elements. They are basically boxes that can hold information or things. The main difference is that a `<div>` is a block element and a `<span>` is an inline element.  
  
Just like our block of code:
```html
<div>
  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>
</div>
```  
or inline code: `<span>My first paragraph.</span>`.
