# Height and Width
We can set the `height` and `width` of an element with the `height` and `width` properties.  
```css
body {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
}
```  

In addition to `height` and `width`, we can also use `min-height` and `min-width` to set the minimum height and width of an element, as well as `max-height` and `max-width` for the maximum height and width.  

```css
body {
  min-height: 100px;
  min-width: 100px;
  max-height: 200px;
  max-width: 200px;
}
```

### Height & Width Exercise
Create a container div with a background color, a different border color, and a different color for the text.  
  - The container should be 500px by 500px.  
  - The border should be 10px wide.  
  - Try to center the div on the page horizontally and vertically.
